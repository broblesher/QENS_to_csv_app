QENS to csv App is a GUI application to parse QENS data recorded in several instruments,
sort it in a matrix form with the scattered intensity S(Q, E) measured at different
Q-values across the columns, and export it to csv files. It also allows to compute
the corresponding susceptibility $\chi$(Q, E) and export it to a csv file.
